# The Y programming language
Y will be launched on June 22nd.

Its core feature is introspection. During bootstrap Y questions its own existence, and from that the parser is generated. Y does not translate to C or assembly or machine code. Instead it materializes directly into RAM because of its declarative nature.

## Source code structure
Y does not have source code. It materializes out of self-doubt. 

## Syntax
Each line needs to start with "Y".

## Performance
Y is as fast as you want it to be.

## Usage
Y requires you to run two processes, `y` and `y_not`. Each statement is simultaneously parsed by `y` and `y_not`. The two processes will subsequently formulate theorems in an attempt to convince each other, until one process throws an "OutOfStamina" exception.

To use Y, it first needs to be bootstrapped. To do this, enter the following statement:
```
Y Y
```

## C/C++ translation
Y can translate your entire C/C++ project. To convert, execute:

```
Y c++
```

You can generate Y code to C++ with:

```
Y not c++
```

## 100Kb with Zero dependencies
Y is only 100Kb on every platform. Y has no dependencies as they are generated on demand.
