# The Y programming language
Y's core feature is introspection. During bootstrap Y questions its own existence, and from that the parser is generated. Y does not translate to C or assembly or machine code. Instead it materializes directly into RAM because of its declarative nature.

## Source code structure
Y does not have source code. It materializes out of self-doubt. 

## Syntax
Each line needs to start with "Y".

## Performance
Y is probably faster than assembly. It compiles 1500x faster than C.

## Usage
The Y parser runs in two processes, `y` and `y_not`. Each statement is simultaneously parsed by `y` and `y_not`. They will formulate theorems in an attempt to convince each other, until one yields `y continue`.

Y generates itself. To bootstrap Y, run:
```
Y Y
```

## C/C++ translation
Y can translate your entire C/C++ project. To convert, execute:

```
Y c++
```

You can generate Y code to C++ with:

```
Y not c++
```

## 100Kb with Zero dependencies
Y is only 100Kb on every platform. Y has no dependencies as they are generated on demand.

## Release date
To find out Y's release date, run this statement:
```
Y release
```
