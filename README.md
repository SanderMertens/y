# The Y programming language
Y's core feature is introspection. During bootstrap Y questions its own existence, and from that the parser is generated. Y does not translate to C or assembly or machine code. Instead it materializes directly into RAM because of its declarative nature.

## Source code structure
Y does not have source code. It materializes out of self-doubt. 

## Syntax
Each line needs to start with "Y".

## Performance
Y is probably faster than assembly. It compiles 1500x faster than C.

## Usage
The Y parser runs in two processes, `y` and `y_not`. Each statement is simultaneously parsed by `y` and `y_not`. They will formulate theorems in an attempt to convince each other, until one runs out of questions and yields `y continue`.

Y generates itself. To bootstrap Y, run:
```
Y Y
```

## C/C++ translation
Y can translate your entire C/C++ project. To convert, execute:

```
Y c++
```

You can generate Y code to C++ with:

```
Y not c++
```

## Patterns
If you are writing code in Y, you do well to follow these well-established patterns that ensure your code is at all times questionable:

### Bikeshedding
Y's resource model is based on a question heap. The Y parser consumes questions from the heap until it is depleted. As such, it is important to always keep your heap populated with a healthy amount of questions. To generate questions, a program has to manage the amount of controversy that is available in a system. If not written carefully, a Y parser can quickly deplete controversy, and thus run out of questions. Bikeshedding is a cheap and effective method to generate large amounts of questions without consuming too much controversy.

### Over-promises
To ensure that Y's parser can run tasks in parallel, a developer should employ over-promising where possible. With this technique, the Y parser can return answers with questionable confidence levels in response to difficult questions. This allows the consumer of the answer to continue its work while the parser may (or may not) continue to work on the question.

### Procrastination
To avoid running out of questions while addressing a particularly hard question, a good technique is to wait an undeterminate amount of time doing nothing in the hope that the question heap repopulates fast enough. Procrastination is particularly effective when used in combination with bikeshedding.

### Pre-emptive releasing
When Y is used in a real-time context, a program may need to finish before a certain communicated time and date. To satisfy these kinds of demanding environments, programs can employ the "pre-emptive release" pattern. With this pattern, the Y parser terminates at said date and dumps its current state. While this is sometimes considered similar to over-promising, this is not correct as a pre-emptive release is not required to produce a result that is an answer to the posed question.

### Garbage recollection
Sometimes considered more of a language feature than a pattern, garbage recollection means that all statements generated by a program must be preserved and presented as a result, even when proven wrong. Producing large quantities of conflicting statements is a well-known technique for keeping the question heap populated while at the same time increasing (albeit artificially) the amount of controversy.

## Release date
To find out Y's release date, run this statement:
```
Y release
```
